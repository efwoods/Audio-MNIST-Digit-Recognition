# Audio-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This is an exploratory jupyter notebook in the creation and tuning of audio models using Artificial Neural Networks.

## Objective
Build an Artificial Neural Network that can examine the spectrograms of recorded audio of spoken digits and classify them into 10 classes each of which are representative of 10 digits 0 through 9. Then, tune the model to identify architecture vs. resource requirements with respect to number of layers and number of epochs.
